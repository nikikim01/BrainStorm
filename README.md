# BrainStorm

-> the overarching webapp that is your digital sanctuary
=> Think of BrainStorm as your second brain--an innovative space designed to enhance your cognitive capabilities and keep your memories well-organized... a place where you can get to better know yourself and brainstorm who you best want to be

## Sub-Project _HackAR_ Overview

=> a Hack-based microservice for image processing, ensuring that your photos are perfectly formatted to fit your desired aspect ratio (AR).

- resizes images and fills excess space with a black background to prevent cropping or resolution loss

## Sub-Project _PunnyPix_ Overview

=> a web app that allows users to upload photos and add notes (hopefully automatically pull captions from photos), with the added functionality of automatic punny caption generation using generative AI

## Sub-Project _TangledThoughts_ Overview

=> an engaging and introspective word association journal prompting game designed to stimulate your mind and inspire self-reflection
-> entegrated AI analyzes your entries, offering insightful prompts that encourage deeper reflection and personal growth
-> use it to unwind, explore your inner thoughts, gain new perspectives, and just have fun

## Project Plan

### Core Technologies

**Front End**

- Redux with React to manage states
- Relay for GraphQL data fetching
- (webpack)[https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/]

        - to serve up frontend code by compiling JS modules

**Backend**

- Node.js

- Express

  - to more easily manage routes and middleware, handle HTTP methods, and build a structured web server

- (Apollo Server)[https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/getting-started]

  - to handle GraphQL-specific logic, e.g. parsing, validating, and executing GraphQL queries and mutations & to integrate Express as middleware to handle requests at specific endpoints

- fs module

  - for async file reading in node apps

- (Mongoose)[https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html]
  - used more high level approach to manage connection (e.g. `mongoose.connect` over `mongoose.connection.openuri`)
- Hack using hhvm

        - **TODO** develop a microservice later on to incorporate hack? or try new project

- (graphql-tools)[https://the-guild.dev/graphql/tools]

**GenAI**

- PyTorch for automatic punny caption generation

**Database, Storage, and Deployment**

    - MongoDB
    - GCP
    - Docker with Volumes

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- NPM

# TODO ^ and below

#### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nikikim01/PunnyPix.git

cd backend
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the backend directort to add the following environment variables:

# TODO below

```

```

#### Frontend setup

1. Navigate to frontend directory

```bash
cd ../frontend
```

2. Run frontend development server
   `npm start`

## Testing

`npm test`

(jest and supertest reference)[https://medium.com/@csalazar94/javascript-testing-made-easy-a-step-by-step-guide-with-jest-and-supertest-8e2a35f13506]

- (supertest module)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest]

  -

# docker

`docker-compose up --build` to build the Docker images and start the frontend, backend, hackAR services
`docker-compose down` to stop them

to run individually:

1. `docker-compose up -d mongodb` to run mongodb in the background
2. `docker-compose up --build backend` to build and start the backend service
3. `docker-compose up --build frontend` to build and start the frontend service

# NEED TO ADDRESS LATER

- [ ] clean up dev vs. prod dependencies in backend
- [ ] reorganize index.test.js code structure - currently not very optimal...
- [ ] try implementing mock tests instead of actually mutating database
- [ ] allow autogenerated caption to replace caption later on
- [ ] allow drag-and-dropped images to be stored in google cloud storage(Google Cloud Storage with GraphQL)[https://n8n.io/integrations/google-cloud-storage/and/graphql/]
