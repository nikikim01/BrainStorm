      This app uses React, Redux, React Router, and many other helpful
      libraries. Mainly just adding bits and pieces of programming languages,
      libraries, frameworks, tools, etc. to practice my coding skills. \n Ask me
      for access to my private github repo for detailed README.md documents.
